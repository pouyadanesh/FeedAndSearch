# FeedAndSearch

you just have to clone/download the project and run it.

it acctually was a good test project because it challenged me in following ways:
  - using compose for grid and the fact that I needed to change the spacing made sure I really get into it
  - using pagination, which by the way I used paging 3, and it was challenging because the api did not provide any pagination properties so I did not implement 5 pages and did just 2
  - I used MVI architecture with only search query as state changer
  
overall I think it was a good experience and I learned alot 
I could spend another day just changing the UI, now I just focused on it being smooth, after smoothness there are a lot of things to be concidered in a good user experience. So I am sorry for that.

I made one wrong move and it was starting with grid itself but I had to start with pagination and it was because my previous experiences told me that if the grid was okay I could simply add pagination to it but it was harder than I expected.

this project was suttle and I had a lot of fun coding this
